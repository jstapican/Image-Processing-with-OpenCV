# Image-Processing-with-OpenCV
This project contains basic image procesing operations using OpenCV and Python.

As a demonstration, this also include a basic project for Object Counting using Contours.

Image Processing Techniques Used:
1. Calling Relevant Packages: imutils, cv2
2. Loading an Image
3. Extracting Regions of Interest using Array Slicing and Cropping
4. Rotating an Image
5. Smoothing/Blurring an Image to reduce Noise
6. Drawing a Line, Rectangle or Circle over an Image
7. Adding a Text over an Image
8. Resizing an Image while Preserving Aspect Ratio

Basic Object Detection Project:
> Using Python and OpenCV to count the number of Tetris blocks in a sample image.

1. Calling Relevant Packages: argparse, imutils, cv2
2. Loading an Image
3. Grayscaling an Image - Reduces the Noise
4. Edge Detection - For finding boundaries and segmentation; Using Canny Algorithm
5. Thresholding - Helps remove lighter or darker regions and finding the contours of images.
6. Detecting and Drawing Contours
7. Adding Text Labels over an Image
8. Erosions and Dilation - Used to reduce noise in binary images (a side effect of thresholding)
9. Masking and Bitwise Operations - Still need further review
